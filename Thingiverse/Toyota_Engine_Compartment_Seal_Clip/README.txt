# Summary

After a certain national Windscreen replacement company replaced a cracked windscreen on my Toyota Avensis D4D Tourer (Estate) I noticed a lot of moisture in the engine compartment.  

I traced the problem back to the seal at the top of the bonnet where the seal had once been attached to the engine compartment it was now free to move to the incorrect positions.  

I can't blame the last guy to change my windscreen, as there was also glue on the seal where the guy before him had tried to disguise the fact he'd lost or broken some of the car's clips.  

So here's a photo.  

Bathrobotics.  

The original clip is the central and white one, the others are 3D printed ones (I was at the end of the Green Filament and just switched to Pink as no one will see these unless I post them online).  

They have been Acetone Vapour Bathed in a Â£10 coffee filter maker from PC WORLD.  

Bath Robotics aka EurIng Andy Southern has challenged myself to release 1 design to open source per day. I think I've lasted longer than on other New Years Resolutions.  

This is for 11th January 2015.  

These Clips fit Toyota but are not toyota parts. I do not claim them to been toyota. I do not use Toyota Logo. No Toyotas have been harmed in the making of this design.
