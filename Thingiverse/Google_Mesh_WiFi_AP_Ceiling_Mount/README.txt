# Summary

Google WiFi Mesh AP ceiling mount.  This design takes advantage of the light slot to secure it to the mount.  Highly recommenced to use a zip tie to keep the tabs secure in the slots.  Some sanding may be required on the tabs to make them fit in the slot.  Screws must be flush so some counter sinking is required.  I built this thing for my garage so not that attractive for living spaces.

The pictures are of a prior version without the zip tie guides.  I've not printed one with the guides so any feedback would be appreciated.

Up Mini 2 with Flex Plate.  ABS+  .35 layer height.  This took about 6 tries to get it to stick to the plate and finally after using painters tape with spray adhesive it printed flat.
