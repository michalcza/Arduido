# Summary

Lenses on VR equipment are very sensitive to sunlight, and the Oculus Go headset does not come with a cover or case so I designed a fitted protector for the lenses and also incorporated a holder for the controller.  Designed in 2 pieces so it can be printed flat, the controller holder snaps into the hole and is rotatable, it's a little tight but it will fit and I didn't want it to freely rotate.  

There is a 2nd version of the cover without the logo and the controller hole moved to the center, in case you would prefer that one.
