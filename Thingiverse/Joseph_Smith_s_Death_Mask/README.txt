# Summary

This is a scan of the Prophet Joseph Smith's death mask from the LDS Church History Museum in downtown Salt Lake City, UT.  I still need to go in and clean up the back side so it has a flat back to print with as well as remove the bump on the chin from the stand the mask was sitting on.

**Update 2 Oct 2017**
I finally got around to smoothing out where the clips are and making a flat back to assist with printing.  I'm not the most thrilled with the smooth job since it removes the texture that the rest of the mask scan has so I'm going to include several versions in addition to the original.  This will give you options.

1)  Original scan but now with a flat bottom
2)  Fixed and the chin clip removed
3)  Fixed and all clips removed

# How I Designed This

First I scanned the mask using 123Catch (http://www.123dapp.com/catch/Joseph-Smith-s-Death-Mask/5820290). Then I removed the extra parts from the scan using MeshMaker and repaired the file using NetFabb.
