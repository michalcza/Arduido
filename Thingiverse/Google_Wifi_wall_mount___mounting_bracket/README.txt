# Summary

I bought a Google Wifi system and quickly realized that it does not have a way to mount it onto the wall, so I designed one. This wall mount, will allow you to hang your Google Wifi with no problem. Be sure you use dry wall anchors to keep the screws from being pulled out from your wall. Also, supports are only needed for the small wire hole at the bottom of the model, you do not need them for the overhangs at the top of the model. I hope you guys enjoy it!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: LulzBot
Printer: TAZ 6
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .2
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
I printed this in PLA, however, I am sure ABS would do just fine as long as you account for the shrinkage. I usually increase the model by 1% when printing in ABS to account for this.
